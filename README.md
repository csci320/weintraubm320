This is a template repo for CSCI 320: Database Systems.

Create your own GitHub repo using this template. Your repo should be owned by the `csci320` organization, and named with your username. It must be a *public* repo.

Then, create a GitPod workspace based on your new repo. You can do this by pointing your browser to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/csci320/YOUR-REPO-NAME

"Pin" the GitPod workspace so that it will not be deleted. Unpinned workspaces are automatically deleted if they are not used for a certain period of time.

In GitPod, create a branch named `wip`. You do not have rights to push to `master`. You will submit your work by creating text files on the `wip` branch in the GitPod workspace, and submitting GitHub pull requests to `master`.Â 

GitPod workspaces go to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity. When they do, you will lose any unsaved file changes. Be sure to save regularly to avoid this.
