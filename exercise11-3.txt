you cant perform this self join the only thing 
we have is the assistants email in the staff table
no names for them 
did i miss something i described several 
tables and found nothing?

mysql> select a.first_name, a.last_name, a.location, b.first_name, b.last_name, b.location, assistant_email
    -> from staff a join staff b
    -> on a.first_name = b.last_name
    -> left outer join location
    -> on staff.location = location.location;
ERROR 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'staff.location' in 'on clause'
mysql>
